<p>Welcome to the Soul-Fragments wiki!
This mod introduces the concept of souls to the game. When you play, you have something called a "soul," in which you loose pieces of it slowly over time. Please note that <strong>loosing health DOES NOT decrease your soul amount.</strong> However, when you die, you loose all your soul, and vice versa. You are able to gain more "souls" through killing special bosses. You also get something called "regeneration energy." Killing bosses will give you more regen energy, but traveling through time and the Abaton dimensions (I'll get to that) will give you more. Regeneration energy will replenish your souls when you are almost out. You will get a max of 13 regenerations,but you'll start with none. You must replenish 1 full regeneration energy slot in order to start regenerating (at the price of loosing that slot). When you finally die (run out of 13 regeneration slots and your soul), you will be dropped into the underworld dimension.</p>

<p>This is a "doorway" to other dimensions. To access this dimension, you need to craft an inter-dimension ring, with the "Otherworldy Dust." When you hold the ring, you will be transported to the other dimension - be careful! When you reach the dimension, you will be greeted with a peculiar looking forest. Near you, there will be generated pools of water. Some deep, some shallow, and some dry. Explore and build a house, but be wary, as your soul will slowly drain away the longer you stay. As you become drained, you will be effected with weakness. Hint: Pack some bottled souls. Brave explorers will find the Fortress with the The inside. Something ancient lies within the dark walls. Something is watching you. Don't linger in Abaton. Put on the ring, jump into a pool, and leave the place be.<br>
<em>In Ancient Greece, Abaton is a place inside the temple of Asclepios where patients slept. Sleep well my friends.</em><br>
<em>Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. -The Sixth Doctor (Doctor Who, BBC)</em></p>

<p>This is a dark pool in the gateways of Abaton. You go there when you die. Face the trails. You make it, great. You fail, you start over.</p>
